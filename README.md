Tweets are pre-processed. This step normalizes, scales, and standardizes the data. Gender sentiment is essential for targeting and managing the conversations that drive online communities. The gender sentiment algorithm provides insight for building and or managing social media campaign strategies. 
K-fold cross-validation is used to rank models. The evaluation metric is accuracy and kappa for the Gender Prediction algorithm.  In addition, the exploratory plots offer sentiment scope and important relationships between features, gender categories, and specific families of hashtags.
